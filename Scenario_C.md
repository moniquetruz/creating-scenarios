Hi Anne,

Thanks for your interest in applying for our Summer Interview Prep course. However, the deadline for submission on pre-work assignment was last March 20th. As of now, the class is full and we already have a long waitlist of applicants. We would be glad to invite you to apply again next year since we run this course every summer, but we feel bad knowing that you are already graduating this Spring and will be ineligible to take our course next year.

So, we are happy to share [our high-level software interview guide](http://tinyurl.com/codepathinterviewguide) which contains tips and guidelines that you might find helpful. You could also, visit our [list of Android resources online](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Beginning-Android-Resources#beginning-android-resources) for more reference.

In the meantime, you may sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) so we could notify you if CodePath offers future courses or virtual events that you might be interested in.

Thanks for your understanding.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
