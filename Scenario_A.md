Hi John,

Congratulations on qualifying for the Interview Prep program!

Please be reminded that we admit students based on their technical interview skills. We purposely assign students according to this guideline so we could assure that each of our student will get the best experience possible with our courses. We want our students to be challenged with every coursework required of them but not to the point that they would feel too frustrated and thus resulting in incompletion of the entire course. And based on your pre-work score, you best fit to our Intermediate track.

To get you started, please review the [course requirements](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/cybersecurity_university/course_overview#heading-requirements) and [policies and expectations](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/cybersecurity_university/course_overview#heading-course-policies).
*	We hold all professional and university students to audaciously high standards, so make sure you know what you're signing up for!

One more thing, take note that the **course begins on the first week of your fall semester**.

For questions, please email us at admissions@codepath.org.

We are so glad to have you in this course!

All the best,

CodePath.org
