Hi Jane,

Thank you for putting an effort in building the Flix app. All of our applications have at least two sections for eligibility checks on the front page. We apologize if we were not clear enough about it and we will take note of this moving forward as we continue to improve our process. Since you do not qualify for the following course requirements:

**1. 	Enrolled in the US university
2. 	Physically present in the Bay Area for each on-site session during the 8-week period**

We regret to inform you that you cannot be admitted in the iOS CodePath Bootcamp. And please know that your hard work would never be considered wasted as you certainly gained more knowledge and honed your skills by creating the Flix app yourself.

In addition, we are happy to share that CodePath already begun extending its services to other areas, such as Haiti. We even used to run classes in Taiwan before. So, it would not be impossible for CodePath to further expand to other countries in the future, like Thailand. But as of now, our courses are restricted to students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States based on the current sponsorships we receive as a non-profit organization.

For now, you can sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) so we could notify you when classes become available in your area powered by local organizers or through remote means. You can also learn a lot from our list of Android resources online.

We hope to be able to bring programs to your area soon and expand our audience for future programs. Thanks for your understanding.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
